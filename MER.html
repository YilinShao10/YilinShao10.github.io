							<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
							<p>During my time in the music emotion computing group at NEXTLAB, Zhejiang University, I contributed as a designer by conceptualizing product functionalities and creating low-fidelity prototypes. This team explored how to harness emotion analysis to automatically generate or select background music for videos. Later, this technology was successfully integrated into a mini-program for the Hangzhou Asian Games, with many of the features I proposed being implemented in the final product. My key contributions included:
								
								<ol>
												<li>Collaborating and conceptualizing product functionalities that harnessed emotion analysis to automatically generate or select background music for videos.</li>
												<li>Developing low-fidelity prototypes to visualize the core interactive features, including dynamic music generation and an interactive venue map.</li>
												<li>Devising an interactive map that encouraged user engagement by enabling check-ins at various sports venues, video recording, and digital badge collection during the Asian Games.</li>
												
								</ol>
								
								
								</p>
						
							<h3 class="major">More Considerations</h3>
							<p>Building on this early experience, I have since developed a deeper interest in voice emotion recognition. For instance, while Apple’s Siri serves as a competent voice assistant, its responses are uniform and often lack emotional nuance—everyone hears the same mechanical tone. I envision a demo that adjusts voice responses dynamically based on the user's tone and emotional cues. This system would analyze the user's speech in real time and provide feedback that reflects a more personalized and empathetic interaction.</p>

							<h3 class="major">Demo</h3>
							<p>I am currently developing a demo to showcase this innovative idea. In this demo, users will speak into the system, and based on their detected emotional tone, the system will alter its vocal feedback—varying pitch, timbre, and expressiveness—to create a more natural and emotionally attuned response. The demo will be uploaded soon.</p>
